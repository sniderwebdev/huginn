// THE PRETOOLUSE EXIT-CODE CONTRACT — read this before changing anything here.
//
// Claude Code interprets a PreToolUse hook's exit code as follows:
//
//	0  — stdout is parsed as JSON for a permission decision. An explicit
//	     {"permissionDecision":"deny"} BLOCKS the tool. This is the path this
//	     command takes, and it is empirically verified against the real CLI.
//	     Exit 0 with no parseable decision means "normal permission flow" —
//	     it neither approves nor blocks.
//	2  — blocking error. THE ONLY EXIT CODE THAT BLOCKS BY ITSELF.
//	any other (1, 127, killed, …) — NON-BLOCKING error. The error is logged
//	     and THE ACTION PROCEEDS. A hook that dies before it prints does not
//	     block anything; it fails OPEN.
//
// So the invariant this file exists to hold is: the `huginn claude-approve`
// process must ALWAYS print a decision and exit 0, and when it cannot print at
// all it must exit 2 — the only remaining way to say "no".
//
// Corollary: nothing on this command's route may os.Exit non-zero. That is why
// main() dispatches `claude-approve` before it loads config or does anything
// else that can call fatalf, and why claudeApproveMain recovers from panics.

// claudeApproveTimeout bounds how long the http.Client in runClaudeApprove
// waits for Huginn. It does NOT cover the rest of the process: claudeApproveMain
// resolves the endpoint before runClaudeApprove and outside this budget. That
// step only reads local disk (and only when --endpoint was not supplied, which
// the hook command Huginn generates always supplies), so its practical risk is
// low, but it means the real wall-clock time Claude Code sees before we print a
// decision is slightly more than this constant.
//
// It MUST stay comfortably below claudecode.ClaudeHookTimeoutSecs. Verified
// against the real CLI: when Claude Code's hook timeout fires it KILLS the hook
// and ALLOWS the tool — a timed-out hook fails OPEN. So our deny has to be
// printed before that happens; racing it is not acceptable for a security
// boundary.
const claudeApproveTimeout = (claudecode.ClaudeHookTimeoutSecs - 10) * time.Second

// Compile-time guard: claudeApproveTimeout must stay strictly positive and
// leave real headroom under the hook timeout. A zero Timeout means "no
// timeout" to http.Client, which would silently reintroduce the fail-open
// race this margin exists to prevent. If this line stops compiling, you
// lowered ClaudeHookTimeoutSecs too far — raise it, do not delete this.

// is dispatched from the very top of main(), before flag parsing, before
// config.Load(), before the logger — before anything that can os.Exit non-zero.
// See the exit-code contract above for why that ordering is load-bearing.
//
// args is os.Args after the subcommand name. It accepts --endpoint <url>
// (equivalently --endpoint=<url>, and the single-dash spellings), which is what
// the generated hook command always passes: the endpoint carries the server's
// REAL bound address, so a web_ui.port of 0 (dynamic allocation) still reaches
// the running server. Without it we fall back to a best-effort config read,
// and a config we cannot read yields an explicit deny rather than a crash.
//
// The named return plus deferred recover is the last-resort guard: an
// unexpected panic anywhere below still prints a deny and exits 0. Only a
// process that cannot print at all exits 2.
