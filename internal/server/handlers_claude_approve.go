// handleClaudeApprove answers a PreToolUse hook from a Claude Code agent.
//
// It ALWAYS responds 200 with a decision object: the hook parses this body, and
// a non-200 would make it fall back to its own deny with a less useful reason.
// Refusal is expressed in the payload, not the status code.
//
// This handler DOES block, for up to approvalDeadline (285s), while a human
// decides. That is the point of the feature and it inverts this function's
// previous contract. The bound is what keeps it safe: 285s is below the hook's
// own client timeout of 290s, which is below Claude Code's 300s hook timeout.
// A hook killed by Claude Code fails OPEN, so the handler must always answer
// first. Never introduce a wait here that is not bounded by approvalDeadline.
//
// Consequence worth knowing: the agent's session semaphore is held for the
// whole wait. One agent can be frozen for five minutes; others are unaffected.
