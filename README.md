## Why Huginn

- **Parallel agents** — multiple agents work concurrently on the same task; you never wait for one to finish before the next starts
- **Persistent code intelligence** — BM25 + vector index built on first run; agents know your codebase, not just your last message
- **Impact analysis** — before touching a file, agents see what depends on it
- **Long-term memory** — decisions made last week are available this session (via MuninnDB)
- **Live delegation** — sub-agents stream their work into a thread panel while you stay in your main conversation

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Launch TUI in any project directory
huginn

# 2. Single-turn non-interactive query (agentic tool loop; no TUI)
huginn --print "what does the auth middleware do?"
huginn --agent Steve --print "Use bash to run hostname" --dangerously-skip-permissions --json

# 3. Launch the web UI (opens at http://localhost:8421)
huginn tray

# 4. Run a specific named agent
huginn --agent Steve "refactor internal/db/query.go to use prepared statements"
```
